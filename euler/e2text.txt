For this problem we had to return the sum of all of the even numbers in the fibonacci sequence.
I created a function called 'sequence' to deal with the actual calculation of the fibonacci sequence.
I then would pass in a number to the squence and return it, it would then be printed out. 
The number is then checked if it is odd or even, if it is odd nothing happens.
If the number returned is even it is then added to the total. 
This process continues in a loop while the number is less the 4million.
