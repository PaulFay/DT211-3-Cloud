This is a simple enough program, it ceated a sum. 
Then enters into a for loop from 1 - 1000.
if the number is divisible ('%') by either 3 or 5 then that number is added to the sum
if it is not divisible then nothing happens and we move onto the next number.
When the loop reaches 1000 it stops and the sum is printed.
